0x03. ES6 data manipulation JavaScript ES6
Moses Muchai, a Lead Software Engineer at Holberton, Mastercard Foundation ALX Software Engineering Short Specialization, is currently engaged in a project focused on ES6 Data Manipulation. This project encompasses various tasks aimed at honing skills in manipulating data within ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). The tasks include creating functions to handle tasks such as retrieving a basic list of objects with specific attributes like id, firstName, and location, extracting ids from a list of objects, filtering objects based on location, and calculating the sum of student ids using map, filter, and reduce functions. Each task is meticulously designed to enhance proficiency in data manipulation techniques within the ES6 framework.
