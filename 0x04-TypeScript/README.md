  0x04. Typescript JavaScript TypeScript


This project is all about diving into TypeScript, a powerful tool for building more robust and scalable JavaScript applications. In Task 0, we're starting by defining what a Student should look like in our system, including details like their first name, last name, age, and location. Then, we're creating a couple of students and displaying them neatly in a table using Vanilla JavaScript. We're making sure everything is typed correctly to catch errors early on. Task 1 takes us into defining a Teacher, making sure they have essential attributes like their name and whether they're a full-time employee. We're also allowing for additional attributes to be added dynamically. Task 2 extends this idea to include directors, who have some additional responsibilities. In Task 3, we're creating a function to neatly print out a teacher's name. Lastly, Task 4 introduces the concept of a StudentClass, setting the stage for further building out our application. It's all about getting comfortable with TypeScript and building solid foundations for our project.
