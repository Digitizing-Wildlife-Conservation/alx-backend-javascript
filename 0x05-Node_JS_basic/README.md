0x05. NodeJS Basics Back-end JavaScript ES6 NodeJS ExpressJS

This project covers the basics of NodeJS through several tasks. It includes scripts for executing basic JavaScript, handling input via stdin, and reading files both synchronously and asynchronously. The first task involves creating a function to print a string to STDOUT. The second task involves a script that interacts with users through the command line, asking for their name and responding accordingly. The third task focuses on reading a CSV file synchronously, counting and logging student data, while the fourth task achieves the same functionality asynchronously and returns a Promise.
