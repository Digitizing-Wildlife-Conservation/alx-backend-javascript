0x06. Unittests in JS UnitTests Back-end JavaScript ES6 NodeJS ExpressJS Mocha Cohort

This project focuses on learning to create unittests in NodeJS using Mocha. The objectives include using Mocha to write test suites, employing different assertion libraries like Node or Chai, presenting long test suites, and understanding when and how to use spies, stubs, and hooks. It also covers unit testing with asynchronous functions and writing integration tests with a small node server. The tasks include installing Mocha via npm, setting up scripts in package.json for running Mocha, creating a function calculateNumber that rounds two numbers and returns their sum, and writing test cases for this function using the Node assertion library. The tests should cover normal and edge cases, and the suite should be runnable with npm test 0-calcul.test.js.
